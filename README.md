  A website to view user's stats on popular Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers
</h1>

(bedrockstats.fun is still being heavily worked on, please report bugs in the Issues tab)

## Ease of use

Just search a user and click "Get stats"

## Open source

Use the source code for whatever you want, just give credit! (no skidding!)

## Wide range of support

Instead of supporting 1 server, we support multiple in the same place!

## Just a stat checker, nothing more

No spooky data collection on our end, just the needed code to display all of your desired stats
